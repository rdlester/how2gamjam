# how2gamjam
a bot that will hopefully convince ppl it is actually a real person working on a video game. starting with text, hopefully expanding to screenshots, audio, and full games.

s/o to dependencies [ebook_your_friends](https://github.com/amandapickering/ebook_your_friends) and [wordfilter](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter). both are included as subtrees instead of submodules, so there's no fancy github autolink, sorry.
