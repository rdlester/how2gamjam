first: scraper.py -> cleaner.py -> runMarkov.py
  scraper:
    - #gamedev is a lot of self promotion.
    - progressively searching backwards during search works up to point where twitter stops returning tweets. how do i detect this to automatically stop scraping?
    - ~40,000 tweets total.
  cleaner:
    - exclude RTs to limit duplication.
    - should take care with @ replies.
    - totally exclude #tags? exclude tweets that are just #tags?
    - initial run cut corpus down to ~20,000 (50%). still too many to do final manual cleaning pass.
  runMarkov.py:
    - using nltk punkt tokenizer works better than simple whitespace tokenizer. too bad there's no haskell implementation around.
    - initially wasn't using cleaned corpus. don't forget that.
  results:
    - it's okay. markov is always kinda jumk and self-promo all-hashtag tweets don't help.
  next:
    - scrape different tag / query to expand corpus?
    - write generative grammar based off patterns in #gamedev?
    - skip text gen and go straight to screenshot gen, game gen.
